Kahn’s algorithm for Topological Sorting

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
For example, a topological sorting of the following graph is “5 4 2 3 1 0?. There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. For example, another topological sorting of the following graph is “4 5 2 0 3 1″. The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with an in-degree of 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).

# A Python program to print topological sorting of a graph
# using indegrees
from collections import defaultdict

# Class to represent a graph
class Graph:
	def __init__(self, vertices):
		self.graph = defaultdict(list) # dictionary containing adjacency List
		self.V = vertices # No. of vertices

	# function to add an edge to graph
	def addEdge(self, u, v):
		self.graph[u].append(v)


	# The function to do Topological Sort.
	def topologicalSort(self):
		
		# Create a vector to store indegrees of all
		# vertices. Initialize all indegrees as 0.
		in_degree = [0]*(self.V)
		
		# Traverse adjacency lists to fill indegrees of
		# vertices. This step takes O(V + E) time
		for i in self.graph:
			for j in self.graph[i]:
				in_degree[j] += 1

		# Create an queue and enqueue all vertices with
		# indegree 0
		queue = []
		for i in range(self.V):
			if in_degree[i] == 0:
				queue.append(i)

		# Initialize count of visited vertices
		cnt = 0

		# Create a vector to store result (A topological
		# ordering of the vertices)
		top_order = []

		# One by one dequeue vertices from queue and enqueue
		# adjacents if indegree of adjacent becomes 0
		while queue:

			# Extract front of queue (or perform dequeue)
			# and add it to topological order
			u = queue.pop(0)
			top_order.append(u)

			# Iterate through all neighbouring nodes
			# of dequeued node u and decrease their in-degree
			# by 1
			for i in self.graph[u]:
				in_degree[i] -= 1
				# If in-degree becomes zero, add it to queue
				if in_degree[i] == 0:
					queue.append(i)

			cnt += 1

		# Check if there was a cycle
		if cnt != self.V:
			print ("There exists a cycle in the graph")
		else :
			# Print topological order
			print (top_order)
