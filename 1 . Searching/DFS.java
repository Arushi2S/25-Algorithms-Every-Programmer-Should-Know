    Graph Class:

This class represents a graph using an adjacency list.
It has private instance variables:
V: The number of vertices in the graph.
adj: An array of linked lists, where each element in the array represents a vertex, and the linked list stores its adjacent vertices.
Constructor:

The Graph constructor takes an integer v as a parameter, representing the number of vertices in the graph.
It initializes the V variable and creates an array of linked lists (adj) with a length of v. Each linked list represents the adjacency list for a vertex.
addEdge Method:

This method allows you to add an edge between two vertices in the graph.
It takes two integer parameters v and w, indicating that there is a directed edge from vertex v to vertex w.
It adds vertex w to the adjacency list of vertex v.
DFSUtil Method:

This is a private recursive helper method for performing Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from a specific vertex.
It takes two parameters: an integer v (the current vertex) and a boolean array visited that keeps track of visited vertices.
It marks the current vertex as visited by setting visited[v] to true and prints the vertex value.
Then, it recursively explores all unvisited neighbors of the current vertex by calling DFSUtil on them.
DFS Method:

This method allows you to perform DFS traversal starting from a specific vertex.
It takes one parameter, an integer v, which is the starting vertex for DFS traversal.
It initializes a boolean array visited with false values to keep track of visited vertices.
It calls the DFSUtil method to start the DFS traversal from vertex v.
main Method:

The main method is the entry point of the program.
It creates an instance of the Graph class with 7 vertices.
It adds edges to the graph to create a simple directed graph with multiple branches.
Finally, it calls the DFS method starting from vertex 0 and prints the result of the DFS traversal.
Overall Functionality:

This code demonstrates how to create a graph and perform Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from a specified vertex.
The DFS algorithm explores vertices and their neighbors in a depth-first manner, printing the visited vertices in the order they are encountered.

/*DFSUtil Method:

This is a private helper method within the Graph class.
It performs a recursive depth-first traversal starting from a given vertex v.
It marks the current vertex as visited, prints its value, and then recursively explores all its unvisited adjacent vertices.
The recursive nature of this function ensures that it explores the graph as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.
DFS Method:

This method serves as the public interface for starting a DFS traversal from a specified vertex.
It initializes an array of boolean values, visited, to keep track of visited vertices.
It calls the DFSUtil method with the starting vertex v and the visited array to kickstart the DFS traversal.
main Method:

In the main method, an instance of the Graph class g is created with 7 vertices.
Edges are added to the graph using the addEdge method to create a simple graph structure with 7 vertices and connections between them.
Finally, a DFS traversal is initiated from vertex 0, and the result is printed to the console.
Overall, this code demonstrates how to perform a depth-first traversal of a graph using a recursive approach. Starting from a specified vertex (in this case, vertex 0), it explores the graph's vertices in a depth-first manner and prints the visited vertices in the order they are traversed.

/*This Java program demonstrates Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a graph. Here's a short description of its key components:

1. `Graph` Class:
   - Represents an undirected graph using an adjacency list.
   - `V` is the number of vertices in the graph.
   - `adj` is an array of linked lists, where each element represents a vertex, and its linked list contains its adjacent vertices.

2. `Graph` Constructor:
   - Initializes the graph with a given number of vertices (`V`).
   - Creates an array of linked lists to store adjacency information for each vertex.

3. `addEdge` Method:
   - Adds an edge between two vertices in the graph by adding the second vertex to the adjacency list of the first vertex.

4. `DFSUtil` Method:
   - A private helper method that performs a recursive Depth-First Search starting from a given vertex (`v`).
   - It marks the current vertex as visited and prints it.
   - Recursively explores all unvisited adjacent vertices of the current vertex.

5. `DFS` Method:
   - Initiates a Depth-First Search traversal from a specified starting vertex.
   - It creates a boolean array to keep track of visited vertices and initializes all vertices as not visited.
   - Calls the `DFSUtil` method to start the DFS traversal.

6. `main` Method:
   - The program's entry point.
   - Creates an instance of the `Graph` class with 7 vertices.
   - Adds edges to create a sample graph.
   - Initiates a DFS traversal starting from vertex 0 and prints the traversal result.

The program demonstrates the DFS algorithm by exploring vertices and their neighbors in a depth-first manner, printing the order in which they are visited.*/
